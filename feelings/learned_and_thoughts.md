### 二、令我触动的话
1. 不要自以为自己足够聪明
	- Google 的工程师都是才智过人的。但是，就算是工作在 Google 的他们，仍然会因为自己不够聪明而感到一种不安。

### 三、过来人的十句忠告
[10 things I wish I knew on my first day at Google](https://medium.com/@moonstorming/10-things-i-wish-i-knew-on-my-first-day-at-google-107581d87286#.tx0y0bnsm)

1. **Outperform your Core (把你的核心做出成就)**
	* Only outperform your core, make sure you can build credibility by nailing what you were hired for, people will appreciate and value all the things you do on the side!
	* If you fall behind in your core-area while you are trying to pursue those many other things, you won't have the track-record(过去的成绩或成就) you need to eventually step out of your core.

2. **Everyone is just one coffee away from you. Ask for it.**
	* In your company, you will come across so many people who either work on interesting projects or seem to have an interesting background--doesn't matter if it's peers, managers or executives. 
	* The simplest thing you can do is to shoot them a quick email and express your interest in picking their brains over a cup of coffee or learn more about the work they do (...and believe me, everyone loves to talk about themselves).

3. **Meeting vs. <font color="blue">Exceeding</font>**
	* "Gold Currency (黄金法则)"：not to meet people's expectations, **but to exceed them**!
	* *"Showing your readiness for the next level by constantly exceeding expectations"*: this is the key to growing one's career. Namely, to leave a lasting impression on the people around and above you **by not just giving them what they ask for, but by doing it better than they could ever have imagined**!
	* Whatever task, whatever target, whatever deliverable and project, always go for the 110%+.
	* In order to get what you want, you need to earn the respect of your peers and managers. How? Exceed their expectations. Once you do that, the rest will follow.

4. **Never ride the wave of your reputation**
	* Never ride the wave of your reputation, just because someone hears you are a high performer, doesn't mean the person will perceive you as such.
	* Never rely on your reputation, but make it your goal to prove yourself with every single person you come across.
	
5. **Surround yourself by excellence**
	* It means that you should bond with and befriend those people who are stellar, from whom you can learn and who can be a guiding light in your career.
	* **Invest in relationships** and be aware of who the "really good people" are (even among the best, you always have the top 10%).
	* Most importantly though, *ask for it* (ref-2). As I said, everyone is just one coffee away.
	
6. **Build bridges** that will take you places one day
	* I truly believe that people cross paths more than just once, so make sure you build as many meaningful "bridges" as possible. *Invest in relationships* (ref-5). 这就是中国的俗语：“多个朋友多条路”！要学会“做关系投资”！
	* Anyone you meet can one day be the person who will help you get the dream job you are looking for. You don’t know it yet, but be aware of the importance every single person might play in your life one day.
	
7. **Careers are not a sprint but a marathon**
	* I was tired of what I was doing and I felt my learning curve was flattening day after day. I was super frustrated with my job! My friend who encouraged me to **think of my career as a marathon and not as a sprint**!
	* What does that mean? Well, <font color="red">just as a marathon goes 42km, a career also goes ±42 years (from 23 to 65)</font> — quite similar. You can’t sprint through the 42km at full speed. 
	* There will be sections you will be running faster than other sections. Some parts will be uphill, others will be downhill. Sometimes you need to stop to refuel and reorient yourself. A career is not much different. You can’t expect to race through it at every single point in time.
	* And **How to deal with this problem?** Remember: To not put yourself under unnecessary pressure but <font color="blue">to focus on effectuating the change you needed</font> (向着目标不断努力).
	
8. **Be a nice guy**
	* Be a nice guy. That’s what my manager told me on the first day I started at Google. People always want to work with nice guys! Eventually, people will want to work for nice guys. That's the Magic!
	* And **How to be a nice guy?** Methods: It’s not that hard. <font color="blue">When you see someone new on the floor, be the one who approaches the person to introduce yourself and welcome him/her. When someone is in need, be the first who offers his help. When someone is successful, be the first who applauds the person. When the weekend is over, don’t be the one who complains that Mondays suck, but be the one who comes in and says that it’s going to be a fecking awesome week, etc</font>.
	* (sorry to break it do you, but *1/7 of your life consists of Mondays* .. you better work on your Monday attitude! )
	
9. We first start aspiring to work for companies. **We end up aspiring to work for people**
	* I wasn’t attracted to Google because of the people, but because of the name. 5 years in, the major reason why I haven’t left yet is not because of the name, but because of the people. You see the change? It’s funny how at the beginning of our careers we always strive to have those brands on our resumes. (我们被名字所吸引，然后被在这个名字的吸引下一起共事的人所征服)
	* At some point it won’t matter to you that much anymore where you work, but who you work with. <font color="red">We start following brands and names, we end up following people and leaders</font>.
	
10. As much as **promotions matter inside (what I did here!)**, they actually don't really matter outside
	* Promotions, while they needed and helpful for me to advance, they don't really matter outside of this place. Once I leave Google, no one will care about whether I'm an “Associate Market Analyst,” a “Level 5” or “whatever the hierarchy at your company is called.” **The day I leave Google, all that matters is what I did here**.
	* <font color="blue">What will matter is **my work experience**, **the impact** I had and **the skills** I learned</font> — not an internal political game that I might or might not have played well.

These are the 10 major lessons I learned throughout my past years. By sharing these insights with you, I hope you think more progressively about your career. 

**Note:** What matters is with what mindset and attitude you approach the many opportunities and relationships that you come across throughout your professional life.
